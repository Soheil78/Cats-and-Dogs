# Cats-and-Dogs
The purpose of my project was to create a model that recognizes Cats and Dogs  on pictures. In order to do that, I created a CNN by using TensorFlow and Keras.
For this project, I used the dataset "Kaggle: Cat VS Dog Dataset" of Karansinh Padhiar that I found on Kaggle. Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karakaggle/kaggle-cat-vs-dog-dataset
This dataset contains arround 12000 pictures per class
You will find my code in the file attached to this repository
